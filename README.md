# Social Media Network using Graphs

## Overview

This project is a console-based social networking application built with Java, utilizing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to manage users and connections. The core functionality involves creating user accounts, connecting with friends, and viewing friend lists, all represented using a graph data structure. The relationships between users are stored as a linked list, based on their unique IDs.

## Features

### 1. **Create Account**
- Users can create an account with the following information:
  - **Name**: The user's name.
  - **Unique ID**: A 5-letter alphanumeric unique identifier automatically generated by the application for each user.
  - **Password**: A secure alphanumeric string that must include:
    - At least one uppercase letter.
    - At least one lowercase letter.
    - At least one digit.
    - At least one special character.

### 2. **Find Friends and Connect**
- Users can search for other users by their unique IDs and directly connect with them. No approval is needed for a connection to be established.

### 3. **Show Friends List**
- Displays the list of friends for a user by searching their unique ID.
- The friendships between users are represented using a graph structure where nodes represent users and edges represent friendships. These relationships are stored in a linked list format.

## Data Structure

### Graph Representation
- **Nodes**: Represent each user in the network.
- **Edges**: Represent friendships between users.
- The graph data structure is implemented using a linked list based on user IDs, with each node containing the user's information and pointers to their connected friends.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-media-network-graph.git
   cd social-media-network-graph
   ```

2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java -d build/
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java -cp build/ Main
   ```

### Example Usage
- Create a new account.
